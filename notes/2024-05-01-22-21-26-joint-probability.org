#+NAME: joint-probability
#+BEGIN_DEFINITION
If \(X\) and \(Y\) are two random variables within the same probability space, the joint probability of \(X\) taking a value \(x\) and \(Y\) taking a value \(y\) is defined as:
\[
P(X = x, Y = y) = P(\{X = x\} \cap \{Y = y\})
\]
#+END_DEFINITION

This formula states that the joint probability of \(X = x\) and \(Y = y\) is the probability that both events \(\{X = x\}\) and \(\{Y = y\}\) occur simultaneously. Joint probability is fundamental in studying the relationships between variables in probability and statistics. It serves as a building block for other concepts like conditional probability and independence.
