#+NAME: Logistic sigmoid function
#+begin_definition latex
The logistic sigmoid function \( \sigma(x) \) is by definition
\begin{align*}
\sigma(x) \equiv \frac{1}{1+\exp (-x)}
\end{align*}
#+end_definition

A plot of the logistic sigmoid function \(\sigma(x)\) is shown in red, together with the scaled probit function \(\Phi(\lambda a)\), for \(\lambda^{2}=\pi / 8\), shown in dashed blue, where \(\Phi(a)\) is defined by (4.114). The scaling factor \(\pi / 8\) is chosen so that the derivatives of the two curves are equal for \(a=0\).

The term 'sigmoid' means S-shaped. This type of function is sometimes also called a 'squashing function' because it maps the whole real axis into a finite interval.

* Properties
+ It satisfies the following symmetry property

\begin{align*}
\sigma(-x)=1-\sigma(x).
\end{align*}

+ The derivative of the logistic sigmoid function can be expressed in terms of the sigmoid function itself

\begin{align*}
\mathrm{D}_x \sigma = \sigma (1-\sigma)
\end{align*}
