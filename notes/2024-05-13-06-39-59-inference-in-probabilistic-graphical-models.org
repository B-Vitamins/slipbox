We turn now to the problem of [[id:01b2eedd-71b0-428f-bc4b-146b7068af36][inference]] in [[id:4588e307-d9cd-4a69-9648-a6c8db14ed1a][Probabilistic graphical models]]: /given that some of the/ [[id:a0fe774b-6d44-4807-ab68-023a7e867ed4][node]] /in a/ [[id:e1fc9380-a936-4cf0-bc64-78119a1081da][graph]] /are clamped to observed values, and we wish to compute the/ [[id:e166b400-40c8-410b-bb5b-0e0decca5f4c][posterior distribution]] /of one or more subsets of other nodes./

We present the simplest possible example of a inference problem for a graphical model:

Consider the graphical interpretation of [[id:731eff69-04dd-45f2-b2a7-968e9c44dc3e][Bayes's theorem]]. The [[id:8c833811-3657-4af4-8be5-191d8788b779][joint probability distribution]] \(p(x,\,y)\) over two variables \(x\) and \(y\) admits the decomposition (see  [[id:e9446808-4593-483e-b66e-adb9cb3db93a][rules of probability]]) \(p(x, y)=p(x) p(y \mid x)\). This is represented by the [[id:5665a889-6a84-4065-be33-f5186d348ea6][Bayesian network]] (a) in the figure below. Suppose now a value of \(y\) is observed (indicated by the shaded node in (b)). Our goal is to obtain the posterior \( p(x \mid y) \). \( p(y) \) is calculable:

\[p(y) = \sum_{x^{\prime}} p(y \mid x^{\prime}) \, p(x^{\prime})\]

With the [[id:98cfed25-404f-4443-9096-e604ca5faccd][marginal probability distribution]] \( p(x) \) as a prior, Bayes's theorem yields

\[p(x \mid y) = \frac{p(y \mid x) p(x)}{p(y)}\]

The inference problem is solved. The joint distribution \(p(x, y)\) is now represented by the graph (c) in the figure below (the direction of the arrow is reversed).

The inference problem for a graphical model can be solved using the techniques of [[id:72d227c3-76fd-433a-bff1-0954500dd35f][exact inference]] or [[id:276580cc-0875-4123-afb0-7af1583390d8][Approximate inference]].
