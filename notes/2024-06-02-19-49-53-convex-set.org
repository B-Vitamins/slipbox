The formal definition of a *Convex set* requires the notion of a [[id:9c711ea1-c9de-4e90-96cf-e7710bd11aeb][vector space]].

#+NAME: Convex set
#+ATTR_LATEX: :environment definition
#+begin_definition latex
Let \(S\) be a vector space over the real numbers. A subset \(C\) of \(S\) is convex if, for all \(x\) and \(y\) in \(C\), the line segment connecting \(x\) and \(y\) is included in \(C\) i.e., \((1-t) x+ ty\) belongs to \(C\) for all \(x, y\) in \(C\) and \(t\) in the interval \([0,1]\).
