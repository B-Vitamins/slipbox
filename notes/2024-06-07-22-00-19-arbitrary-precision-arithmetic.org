In *arbitrary-precision arithmetic*, calculations are performed on numbers whose digits of precision are potentially limited only by the available memory of the host system.

+ Arbitrary-precision arithmetic is usually implemented in software.
+ Compared to [[id:83ef5d58-c92a-4542-8572-2eae0be53b88][fixed-precision arithmetic]], it is slower.
+ Arbitrary-precision arithmetic is available out of the box in languages like Lisp, Python, Perl, Haskell, Ruby and Raku.
