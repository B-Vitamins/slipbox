Kelvin and Clausius's statements for the [[id:be3bfa3c-0208-4857-a67a-67dfda059d65][the second law]] of [[id:39fcc45a-9b91-42f9-9960-19eab99aae83][thermodynamics]] are given below:

#+NAME: The second law of thermodynamics (Kelvin's statement)
#+begin_law latex
No process is possible whose sole result is the complete conversion of heat into work. (K)
#+end_law

#+NAME: The second law of thermodynamics (Clausius's statement)
#+begin_law latex
No process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from a colder to a hotter body. (C)
#+end_law

#+NAME: (K) <=> (C)
#+begin_lemma latex
Kelvin's statement of the second law is equivalent to Clausius's statement of the second law
#+end_lemma

#+NAME: (K) <=> (C)
#+begin_proof latex
(1) \(\neg (C) \Longrightarrow \neg (K)\)

+ Assume a machine that violates Clausius's statement (C) by taking heat \(Q\) from a cooler region to a hotter one.
+ Now consider an engine operating between these two regions, taking heat \(Q_{H}\) from the hotter one and dumping \(Q_{C}\) at the colder sink.
+ The combined system takes \(Q_{H}-Q\) from the hot source, produces work equal to \(Q_{H}-Q_{C}\), and dumps \(Q_{C}-Q\)  at the cold sink.
+ If we adjust the engine output such that \(Q_{C}=Q\), the net result is a \(100 \%\) efficient engine, in violation of Kelvin's statement.

(2) \(\neg (K) \Longrightarrow \neg (C)\)

+ Assume a machine that violates Kelvin's statement (K) by taking heat \(Q\) and converting it completely to work.
+ The work output of this machine can be used to run a refrigerator, with the net outcome of transferring heat from a colder to a hotter body, in violation of Clausius's statement.

(3) \( (K) \Longleftrightarrow (C) \) (follows from (1) and (2)).
