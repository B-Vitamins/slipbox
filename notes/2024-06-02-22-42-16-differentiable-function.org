The definition of a differentiable function depends on the notion of a [[id:ebf7891f-996b-46c5-8c64-0c419b9c0473][function]], [[id:ddfe594a-c9bf-4440-917c-b63780bfc76c][limit]], and [[id:dc7c5812-7a8f-42c6-bddc-a92fe7d64438][open set]].

#+NAME: Differentiable function
#+begin_definition latex
A function \(f: D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\), defined on an open set \(D \subset \mathbb{R}\), is said to be differentiable at \(a \in D\) if the following limit exists:

\begin{align*}
f^{\prime}(a)=\lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}
\end{align*}

This implies that the function is continuous at \(a\).
This function \(f\) is said to be differentiable on \(U\) if it is differentiable at every point of \(U\). In this case, the derivative of \(f\) is thus a function from \(U\) into \(\mathbb{R}\).

The following corollary follows from the definition of a differentiable function. It depends on the notion of a [[id:b5086a0f-7e0b-4568-a5ff-122c26469c69][continuous function]].

#+NAME: Differentiable functions are continuous functions
#+begin_corollary latex
If a function \(f: D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\), defined on an open set \(D \subset \mathbb{R}\), is differentiable at \( a \in D \), then it is continuous at \( a \in D \). The converse is not necessarily true: a continuous function is not necessarily differentiable.
