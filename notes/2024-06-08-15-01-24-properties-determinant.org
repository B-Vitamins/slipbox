#+NAME: Determinant of product of square matrices
#+begin_theorem latex
Let \( M \) and \( N \) be two \( n \times n \) square matrices. The determinant of the product \( M N \) is equal to the product of the determinants of \( M \) and \( N \), i.e.,

\[\det (MN) = \det (M) \det (N).\]
#+end_theorem

#+NAME: Determinant of transpose of square matrices
#+begin_theorem latex
Let \( M \) be a \( n \times n \) square matrices. The determinant of the transpose \( M^{\top} \) of \( M \) is equal to the determinant of \( M \), i.e.,

\[\det (M^{\top}) = \det (M).\]
#+end_theorem

#+begin_theorem latex
Let \( M \) be a \( n \times n \) square matrices. Let \( M_{\text{ex}} \) be a matrix obtained by exchanging any two rows or any two columns of \( M \). The determinant of \( M_{\text{ex}} \) is given by

\[\det (M_{\text{ex}}) = -\det (M).\]
#+end_theorem

#+begin_theorem latex
Let \( M \) be a \( n \times n \) square matrices. Let \( M_{\text{a}} \) be a matrix obtained by rescaling one of the rows or columns of \( M \). The determinant of \( M_{\text{a}} \) is given by

\[\det (M_{\text{a}}) = a \det (M).\]
