The definition of an closed interval depends on the notion of an [[id:25fea2d5-0073-4742-b97b-5d88c8c29fe9][interval]] and its endpoints.

#+NAME: Open interval
#+begin_definition latex
A closed interval is an interval that includes all its endpoints and is denoted with square brackets.
#+end_definition

An example of an closed interval is \([0, 1]\) which consists of all real numbers greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1.

Closed intervals have the following form

\begin{align*}
[a, b]=\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid a \leq x \leq b\}
\end{align*}

where \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers such that \(a \leq b\).

The empty set and \(\mathbb{R}\) are the only intervals that are both [[id:1a249a1e-6223-4431-91a5-f0e9f58baaa4][open]] and closed.
