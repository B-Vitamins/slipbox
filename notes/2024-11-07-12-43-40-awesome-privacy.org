** Privacy vs Security vs Anonymity
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: privacy-vs-security-vs-anonymity
:END:
Anonymity, Privacy, and Security are often used interchangeably, but they actually represent distinct concepts. It is important to understand the differences between them.

- Privacy is about regulating who has access to your personal information, being aware of the data that is being collected about you, and having the ability to decide who can access it and how. In short, privacy involves controlling your personal information.

- Security refers to safeguarding your personal information from unauthorized access or theft. It involves ensuring that your data is protected and stored in a secure manner, making it difficult for malicious actors to access it.

- Anonymity is about ensuring that your actions cannot be traced back to you. This means that even if someone discovers what you are doing, they will not be able to identify you as the source.

It is important to note that privacy and security are not necessarily interdependent. For instance, Google systems are secure and unlikely to be hacked, but Google still has access to your personal data and makes use of it.

Privacy and anonymity are also not necessarily linked, services like Signal offer high levels of privacy since they do not collect any data about what you say, who you talk to or how you use the app, but they may not be anonymous since you still need to register using your phone number (which is in many cases linked to your identity).

Finally, there are services that may offer all three: anonymity, privacy, and security. The primary focus of this list is to provide alternatives that prioritize privacy. These alternatives give you control over your data and do not collect or sell it.
