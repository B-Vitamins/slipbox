A *reversible transformation* is one that can be run backward in time by simply reversing its inputs and outputs. /It is the [[id:39fcc45a-9b91-42f9-9960-19eab99aae83][thermodynamic]] equivalent of frictionless motion in mechanics/. All reversible transformations are [[id:66684beb-eef9-4c9b-bd1e-c60b025420a3][quasi-static transformation]]. The converse is not true in general.

#+NAME: Reversible transformations
#+begin_theorem latex
If a transformation is reversible, then it is quasi-static too.
#+end_theorem

#+NAME: Reversible transformations
#+begin_proof latex
1) Time reversibility at all stages of the transformation implies thermal equilibrium at all stages of the transformation.
2) A quasi-static transformation, by definition, is one in which the system is always in thermal equilibrium.
3) From (1) and (2) it follows that if a transformation is reversible, then it is quasi-static.
