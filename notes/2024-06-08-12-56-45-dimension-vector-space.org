The definition of *dimension* depends on the notion of a [[id:9c711ea1-c9de-4e90-96cf-e7710bd11aeb][vector space]].

#+NAME: Dimension of a vector space
#+ATTR_LATEX: :environment definition
#+begin_definition latex
A vector space has dimensions \(n\) if it can accomodate a maximum of \(n\) linearly independent vectors. When such a vector space is defined over the field of real numbers it is denoted by \(\mathbb{V}^n(R)\). When it is defined over the field of complex numbers it is denoted by \(\mathbb{V}^{n}(C)\).

The following theorem about the *dimension* of a vector space depends on the notion of [[id:6764a03f-7428-4357-a45c-57d203fd69f8][orthogonality]].

#+NAME: Dimensionality
#+begin_theorem latex
The dimensional of a vector space equals \(n\), the maximum number of mutually orthogonal vectors in it.
