#+NAME: Shannon's theorem
#+begin_theorem latex
The minimum number of bits necessary to ensure that the percentage of errors in \(N\) trials vanishes in the \(N \rightarrow \infty\) limit is \(\ln _{2} g\). For any non-uniform distribution, this is less than the \(N \ln _{2} M\) bits needed in the absence of any information on relative probabilities.

The *difference per trial* is thus attributed to the /information content/ of the probability distribution, which motivates the definition of  [[id:4b4a37a4-cf1f-4d6b-843f-fd5edffeca0c][information]].
