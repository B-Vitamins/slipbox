High-temperature expansions work equally well for discrete and continuous spin systems. The basic idea is to start with independent spins, and expand the partition function in powers of \(\beta=\left(k_{\mathrm{B}} T\right)^{-1}\), i.e.

\[
Z=\operatorname{tr}\left(\mathrm{e}^{-\beta \mathcal{H}}\right)=\operatorname{tr}\left[1-\beta \mathcal{H}+\frac{\beta^{2} \mathcal{H}^{2}}{2}-\cdots\right]
\]

and

\[
\frac{\ln Z}{N}=\frac{\ln Z_{0}}{N}-\beta \frac{\langle\mathcal{H}\rangle_{0}}{N}+\frac{\beta^{2}}{2} \frac{\left\langle\mathcal{H}^{2}\right\rangle_{0}-\langle\mathcal{H}\rangle_{0}^{2}}{N}-\cdots
\]

The averages \langle\rangle\(_{0}\) are calculated over non-interacting spins. For the Ising model, it is more convenient to organize the expansion in powers of \(\tanh K\) as follows. Since \(\left(\sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}\right)^{2}=1\), the Boltzmann factor for each bond can be written as

\[
\mathrm{e}^{K \sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}}=\frac{\mathrm{e}^{K}+\mathrm{e}^{-K}}{2}+\frac{\mathrm{e}^{K}-\mathrm{e}^{-K}}{2} \sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}=\cosh K\left(1+t \sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}\right),
\]

where \(t \equiv \tanh K\) is a good high-temperature expansion parameter. Applying this transformation to each bond of the lattice results in

\[
Z=\sum_{\left\{\sigma_{i}\right\}} \mathrm{e}^{K \sum_{\langle i, j\rangle} \sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}}=(\cosh K)^{\text {number of bonds }} \sum_{\left\{\sigma_{i}\right\}\langle i, j\rangle} \prod_{1}\left(1+t \sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}\right)
\]

For \(N_{b}\) bonds on the lattice, the above product generates \(2^{N_{b}}\) terms, which can be represented diagrammatically by drawing a line connecting sites \(i\) and \(j\) for each factor of \(t \sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}\). Note that there can at most be one such line for each lattice bond, which is either empty or occupied. This is a major simplification, and a major advantage for the use of \(t\), rather than \(K\), as the expansion parameter. Each site now obtains a factor of \(\sigma_{i}^{p_{i}}\), where \(p_{i}\) is the number of occupied bonds emanating from \(i\). Summing over the two possible values \(\sigma_{i}= \pm 1\), gives a factor of 2 if \(p_{i}\) is even, and 0 if \(p_{i}\) is odd. Thus, the only graphs that survive the sum have an even number of lines passing through each site. The resulting graphs are collections of closed paths on the lattice, and

\[
Z=2^{N} \times(\cosh K)^{N_{b}} \sum_{\text {All closed graphs }} t^{\text {number of bondsin the graph }} .
\]

For a \(d\)-dimensional hypercubic lattice, the smallest closed graph is a square of four bonds which has \(d(d-1) / 2\) possible orientations. As the next graph has six bonds,

\[
Z=2^{N}(\cosh K)^{d N}\left[1+\frac{d(d-1) N}{2} t^{4}+d(d-1)(2 d-3) t^{6}+\cdots\right],
\]

and

\[
\frac{\ln Z}{N}=\ln 2+d \ln \cosh K+\frac{d(d-1)}{2} t^{4}+\cdots
\]

In the following sections we shall employ high-temperature expansions not as a numerical tool, but to establish the following: (a) exact solution of the Ising model in \(d=1\); (b) the duality relating models at low and high temperatures; (c) the validity of the Gaussian model in high dimensions; (d) exact solution of the Ising model in \(d=2\).
