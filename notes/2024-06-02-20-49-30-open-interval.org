The definition of an open interval depends on the notion of an [[id:25fea2d5-0073-4742-b97b-5d88c8c29fe9][interval]] and its endpoints.

#+NAME: Open interval
#+begin_definition latex
An open interval does not include any endpoint, and is indicated with parentheses.

An example of an open interval is \((0,1)=\{x \mid 0<x<1\}\) which consists of all real numbers greater than 0 and less than 1. Another example of an open interval is \((0,+\infty)\) which consists of real numbers greater than 0 , i.e., positive real numbers.

Open intervals have one of the forms

\begin{align*}
(a, b) & =\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid a<x<b\} \\
(-\infty, b) & =\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x<b\}, \\
(a,+\infty) & =\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid a<x\}, \\
(-\infty,+\infty) & =\mathbb{R}
\end{align*}

where \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers such that \(a \leq b\).

When \(a=b\) in the first case, the resulting interval is the empty set \((a, a)=\varnothing\). 

The empty set and \(\mathbb{R}\) are the only intervals that are both open and [[id:53970f58-7d16-431f-a043-dce420e86937][closed]].
