#+TITLE: Householder matrix
#+FILETAGS: :concept:
#+SETUPFILE: ~/.config/emacs/setup/setupfile.org

* Definition
The definition of the *Householder matrix* depends on the notion of a [[id:30d7411c-87ab-4015-a5b5-5654719f050e][Householder transformation]].

#+NAME: Householder matrix
#+begin_definition latex
The Householder transformation defines the Householder matrix which is defined in terms of the outer product of the normal vector of the reflection hyperplane with its adjoint.
\[H \equiv I - 2 \vert w_{\bot} \rangle \langle w_{\bot} \vert.\]
#+end_definition

* Properties

#+NAME: The Householder matrix is Hermitian
#+begin_theorem latex
The Householder matrix \( H \) is Hermitian, i.e.,
\[H = H^{\dagger}.\]
#+end_theorem

#+NAME: The Householder matrix is unitary
#+begin_theorem latex
The Householder matrix \( H \) is unitary, i.e.,
\[H^{\dagger} H = H H^{\dagger} = I.\]
It follows that \(H^{-1}=H^{\dagger}\).
#+end_theorem

#+NAME: The Householder matrix is involutory
#+begin_theorem latex
The Householder matrix \( H \) is involutory, i.e.,
\[H H = I.\]
It follows that \( H = H^{-1} \).
#+end_theorem

#+NAME: Eigenvalues of Householder matrix
#+begin_theorem latex
A Householder matrix has eigenvalues \(\pm 1\).
#+end_theorem

#+NAME: Eigenvalues of Householder matrix
#+begin_proof latex
To see this, notice that if \(\vert v \rangle\) is orthogonal to the vector \(\vert w_{\bot} \rangle\) which was used to create the reflector, then \(H \vert v \rangle = \vert v \rangle\), i.e., 1 is an eigenvalue of multiplicity \(n-1\), since there are \(n-1\) independent vectors orthogonal to \(\vert v \rangle\). Also, notice \(H \vert w_{\bot} \rangle=- \vert w_{\bot} \rangle\), and so -1 is an eigenvalue with multiplicity 1.
#+end_proof

#+NAME: Determinant of Householder matrix
#+begin_theorem latex
\[\det (H) = - 1.\]
#+end_theorem

#+NAME: Eigenvalues of Householder matrix
#+begin_proof latex
The determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues. Since the eigenvalues of the Householder matrix are \( -1 \) and \( 1 \), it immediately follows that \( \det (H) = - 1 \).
#+end_proof
