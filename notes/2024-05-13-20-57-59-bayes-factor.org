#+NAME: Bayes factor
#+begin_definition latex
Consider a data set \(\mathcal{D}\) and a set of models \(\left\{\mathcal{M}_i\right\}\). The Bayes factor of two models \( \mathcal{M}_i \) and \( \mathcal{M}_j \) over the data set \mathcal{D} is defined as the ratio of their model evidence. The Bayes factor is therefore \(p\left(\mathcal{D} \mid \mathcal{M}_i\right)/p\left(\mathcal{D} \mid \mathcal{M}_j\right)\).
