A *sequence* is a series of scenes that are grouped together to form a larger, cohesive narrative unit within a film. Unlike individual scenes, which focus on a single location or moment in time, sequences encompass multiple scenes that collectively convey a broader action, theme, or story arc. Sequences are often used to build up to a critical moment or to cover a sustained portion of the plot.

* Demarcating a Sequence
Sequences can be identified using the following characteristics:
1. **Unified Goal or Theme**: A sequence usually centers around a single objective or thematic focus, such as a character reaching a destination, planning a heist, or undergoing a transformation.
2. **Chronological Flow**: Sequences often progress in a clear chronological order, although they can also include flashbacks or parallel storylines if they serve a cohesive purpose.
3. **Connected Scenes**: The scenes within a sequence are interlinked, building off each other’s context and leading up to a major event or conclusion within the narrative arc.
4. **Pacing and Tone Shifts**: Sequences frequently have distinct pacing and tone, creating tension, excitement, or calm over a series of scenes.
5. **Closure or Transition**: Sequences typically end with a resolution or shift, often leading into another sequence or major turning point in the story.

* Types of Sequences

+ Opening Sequence :: The initial sequence of a film, designed to establish the world, tone, and central characters or themes. Often includes an *establishing shot* and key expository information.
+ Action Sequence :: A high-energy sequence composed of multiple action scenes, often leading to a climax or a resolution. Action sequences use quick pacing, intense soundscapes, and rapid transitions.
+ Training Sequence :: Shows characters preparing for an event or mission, often condensed into a *montage* to show growth or skill acquisition.
+ Chase Sequence :: A type of action sequence focusing on pursuit, typically involving fast-paced scenes that build tension and stakes.
+ Climax Sequence :: The culmination of the film’s conflict, usually involving heightened tension, risk, and resolution. Often the most intense and emotionally impactful part of the story.
+ Resolution Sequence :: Brings the film to a close, showing the outcomes of the story’s main conflict and character arcs, and often includes a denouement or a return to a state of calm.
