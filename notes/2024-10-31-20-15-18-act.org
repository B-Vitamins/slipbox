An *act* is a large structural division within a film’s narrative, organizing the story into broad segments that guide the audience through the setup, conflict, and resolution. Acts create a rhythm and pacing for the film and are essential to traditional storytelling. Most films follow a **three-act structure**, though some use a *five-act structure* to add complexity and depth.

Acts provide a structured flow for the entire narrative, helping to shape the viewer’s emotional journey through the story. The three-act structure is widely used in mainstream films, while the five-act structure is more common in complex or classical storytelling, offering deeper character development and intricate plots.

* Three-Act Structure

The *three-act structure* is the most widely used narrative format in film, dividing the story into three main sections:

1. *Act 1: Setup*
   - The opening act introduces the setting, main characters, and central conflict or goal. It often includes an *inciting incident* that propels the protagonist into action, moving the story forward.
2. *Act 2: Confrontation*
   - The middle and longest act, where challenges and complications arise. Characters face obstacles that test their resolve, with tension building toward a *midpoint* that shifts the story’s direction.
3. *Act 3: Resolution*
   - The final act resolves the central conflict, typically through a *climax*, where the protagonist confronts the antagonist or overcomes a significant obstacle. It concludes with a *denouement* that provides closure.

* Five-Act Structure

The *five-act structure* divides the narrative into five distinct parts, offering more complexity and detail, often seen in longer films or those with more elaborate storylines.

1. *Act 1: Exposition*
   - Introduces the world, characters, and initial conflict, setting up the stakes and expectations.
2. *Act 2: Rising Action*
   - Challenges arise, developing the conflict and deepening character relationships. The protagonist’s goals are established, but obstacles begin to mount.
3. *Act 3: Climax*
   - The story reaches a peak of conflict, with a crucial turning point that changes the protagonist’s path or understanding. This act is intense and often the emotional core of the story.
4. *Act 4: Falling Action*
   - Events unfold as a result of the climax. Characters deal with the consequences of their actions, leading toward resolution.
5. *Act 5: Denouement*
   - Provides closure to the story, resolving subplots and leaving the characters in a new state, often showing how they have changed or learned.
