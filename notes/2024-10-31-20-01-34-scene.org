A *scene* is a unit of storytelling in a film that takes place within a single location or continuous moment in time, presenting a cohesive action, interaction, or emotional moment. Scenes are typically made up of multiple shots combined through transitions, which convey a specific part of the narrative. Each scene serves a purpose within the film, whether to advance the plot, develop characters, establish setting, or build mood.

* Demarcating a Scene
Scenes can be identified using the following criteria:
1. **Location Consistency**: A scene usually remains in one distinct place. A change in location generally signifies a transition to a new scene.
2. **Temporal Continuity**: Scenes typically follow a continuous flow in time. Any leap forward or backward in time will likely mark the start of a new scene.
3. **Unified Action or Objective**: A scene often centers around a single objective, action, or conversation that provides cohesion. This objective or action usually completes within the scene.
4. **Emotional or Tonal Shift**: When the mood or tone of a moment changes drastically, it often marks the boundary of one scene and the start of another, even within the same location.
5. **Character Focus and Engagement**: A change in the main character’s engagement or in the focus of interaction (like switching between two separate conversations) may indicate a scene change.

* Types of Scenes
Scenes in film vary in purpose and structure, but here are some common types along with hypothetical descriptions and functions.

+ Establishing Scene :: Introduces the setting, context, or world of the story. Typically composed of wide shots, it places characters in a recognizable environment, orienting the viewer.
+ Dialogue Scene :: Focuses on conversations between characters, often to reveal motivations, develop relationships, or introduce conflict. These scenes use close-ups, over-the-shoulder shots, and reverse shots to capture reactions and emotions.
+ Action Scene :: Emphasizes dynamic movement or conflict, like fights, chases, or physical confrontations. Action scenes often employ fast cuts, handheld shots, and tracking shots to create tension and energy.
+ Montage Scene :: Compresses time through a series of quick shots, showing events like training sequences, routines, or character progression. Montages provide information efficiently, allowing for visual storytelling over time.
+ Expository Scene :: Provides essential background information or plot details. Expository scenes are often used to catch the audience up on story events or to lay the foundation for the narrative.
+ Flashback Scene :: A sequence from the past that provides insight into a character’s background or motivations. Flashbacks are often marked by visual or audio cues to signify the shift in time.
+ Dream/Fantasy Scene :: Takes place within a character’s mind, often marked by stylized visuals, altered colors, or surreal elements to distinguish it from the main narrative.
