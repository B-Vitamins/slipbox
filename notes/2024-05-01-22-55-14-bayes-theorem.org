The Bayes's theorem establishes a relationship between [[id:a2ad9677-e9f8-4558-8984-2e2efe72af3c][Conditional probabilities]]:

\[p(X \mid Y) = P(Y \mid X) P(X) / P(Y)\].

The Bayes's theorem follows directly from the [[id:879281b4-8323-4b79-aad6-4b13b71ef663][the product rule of probability]] after realizing that \(P(X, Y) = P(X \cap Y) = P(Y \cap X) = P(Y, X)\).

The [[id:425c495d-aec2-4fff-8f48-f49f08210ebf][The sum rule of probability]] can be used to obtain a rewrite of the Bayes' theorem


\[p(X \mid Y) = \frac{P(Y \mid X) P(X)}{\sum_{X} P(Y \mid X) P(X)}.\]

This form of the Bayes theorem lends itself to the interpretation of establishing the normalization of the [[id:a2ad9677-e9f8-4558-8984-2e2efe72af3c][Conditional probabilities]].
