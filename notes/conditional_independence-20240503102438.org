#+NAME: independence
#+BEGIN_DEFINITION
Events \(X\) and \(Y\) are said to be *independent conditioned on* event \(Z\) if their joint class-conditional probability factorizes as the product of their marginal class-conditional probabilities:
\[
p(X,\, Y \mid Z) = p(X \mid Z) \cdot p(Y \mid Z).
\]
#+END_DEFINITION

When this condition holds, the occurrence of \(Z\) does not affect the occurrence of \( X \) nor \(Y\).
