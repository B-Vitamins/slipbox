#+NAME: conditional independence
#+BEGIN_DEFINITION
Events \(X\) and \(Y\) are said to be *independent conditioned on* event \(Z\) if their joint class-conditional probability factorizes as the product of their marginal class-conditional probabilities:
\[
p(X,\, Y \mid Z) = p(X \mid Z) \cdot p(Y \mid Z).
\]
#+END_DEFINITION

#+NAME: conditional independence
#+begin_corollary latex
If events \( X \) and \( Y \) are independent conditioned on event \( Z \) then
\[p(X \mid Y,\,Z) = p(X \mid Z) \qquad \text{and} \qquad p(Y \mid X,\,Z) = p(Y \mid Z)\]
#+end_corollary

The corollary follows from the definition of conditional independence after applying the [[id:e9446808-4593-483e-b66e-adb9cb3db93a][rules of probability]] to the joint class-conditional probability \( p(X,\,Y \mid Z) \)

\begin{align*}
p(X,\,Y \mid Z) &= p(X \mid Y,\, Z)\, p(Y \mid Z) = p(Y \mid X,\, Z)\, p(X \mid Z)  \equiv p(X \mid Z) p(Y \mid Z) \\
&\Longrightarrow p(X \mid Y,\,Z) = p(X \mid Z) \quad \text{and} \quad p(Y \mid X,\,Z) = p(Y \mid Z).
\end{align*}

Graphical models help identify conditional independence properties without requiring exhaustive use of the [[id:e9446808-4593-483e-b66e-adb9cb3db93a][rules of probability]]. This is achieved by the framework of [[id:971e6cb8-1177-4d9a-90d7-43d22c22fb61][D-separation]].
