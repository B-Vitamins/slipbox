*Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann* was an Austrian physicist who created the field of statistical mechanics. Prior to Boltzmann, the concept of entropy was already known from classical thermodynamics where it quantifies the fact that when we take energy from a system, not all of that energy is typically available to do useful work. Boltzmann showed that the thermodynamic entropy \(S\), a macroscopic quantity, could be related to the statistical properties at the microscopic level. This is expressed through the famous equation \(S=k \ln W\) in which \(W\) represents the number of possible microstates in a macrostate, and \(k \simeq 1.38 \times 10^{-23}\) (in units of Joules per Kelvin) is known as Boltzmann's constant. Boltzmann's ideas were disputed by many scientists of they day. One difficulty they saw arose from the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of a closed system tends to increase with time. By contrast, at the microscopic level the classical Newtonian equations of physics are reversible, and so they found it difficult to see how the latter could explain the former. They didn't fully appreciate Boltzmann's arguments, which were statistical in nature and which concluded not that entropy could never decrease over time but simply that with overwhelming probability it would generally increase. Boltzmann even had a long running dispute with the editor of the leading German physics journal who refused to let him refer to atoms and molecules as anything other than convenient theoretical constructs. The continued attacks on his work lead to bouts of depression, and eventually he committed suicide. Shortly after Boltzmann's death, new experiments by Perrin on colloidal suspensions verified his theories and confirmed the value of the Boltzmann constant. The equation \(S=k \ln W\) is carved on Boltzmann's tombstone.
