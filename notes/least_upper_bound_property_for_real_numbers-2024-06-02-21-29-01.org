The theorem on Least upper bound property (for real numbers) depends on the notions [[id:e15f8f6e-7897-42a0-a7d3-cb70193f9a67][upper bound]] and [[id:dc1d007a-cb98-45cd-b6bd-b036cb0506e1][supremum]].

#+NAME: Least upper bound property (for real numbers)
#+begin_theorem latex
Let \(S\) be a non-empty set of real numbers. The least-upper-bound property states that any non-empty set of real numbers that has an upper bound must have a least upper bound in real numbers.
