#+TITLE: Abstract Factory Pattern
#+FILETAGS: :concept:
#+SETUPFILE: ~/.config/emacs/setup/setupfile.org

* 1. Introduction and Historical Context

The =Abstract Factory= pattern is often taught immediately after the =Factory Method=, due to their conceptual proximity. While the =Factory Method= focuses on creating one product type at a time (albeit with multiple possible implementations), the =Abstract Factory= addresses a scenario involving *families* of related products. This difference is crucial.

In classical object-oriented design, you might have a “WidgetFactory” that can produce buttons, scrollbars, and windows. Each family of these widgets (say, a “Mac OS family” and a “Windows family”) must stay consistent—that is, you don’t want to accidentally mix a Mac button with a Windows scrollbar, lest your UI look disjointed or your code break with incompatible calls. The =Abstract Factory= thus defines an interface for creating each product in a family, ensuring that once you select a particular concrete factory, you get only products that match that family.

This notion of product families and consistency is historically rooted in cross-platform GUI toolkits, where developers had to produce user interface elements for multiple operating systems or user interface “styles.” Over time, the pattern has shown up in a broad range of contexts, from theming engines to multi-database connectors that produce consistent sets of DAOs (Data Access Objects).

** 1.1 Why an Abstract Factory?

- =Consistent Product Families=: If your system has multiple products that must be used together (e.g., a button must match a corresponding text field and window style), the =Abstract Factory= enforces that consistency by tying object creation to a single “family factory.”

- =Easier Swapping of Product Families=: When you want to switch from one set of products (like a “light theme” to a “dark theme”) to another, you simply change which concrete factory you instantiate. The rest of your code remains blissfully unaware of the difference.

- =Reduced Coupling and Clear Boundaries=: The client code references only an abstract factory interface (or base class). The actual product classes remain tucked behind that interface. This fosters an open-closed design, where you can add new families with minimal disruption.

** 1.2 Common Pitfalls

- =Excessive Complexity=: If you only have one product type or no real need to group multiple products into families, =Abstract Factory= might overcomplicate your design. The code overhead of multiple factory classes may not be justified.

- =Rigid Inheritance Structures=: In some implementations, each family typically has to create all the same “slots” of product types. If your actual product set is varied or frequently shifting, an =Abstract Factory= might lead to large, unwieldy factories or repetitive code.

- =Hard to Add New Product Methods=: If you frequently add new product types (e.g., a new widget category every week), you must update the abstract factory interface and all its concrete factory implementations. While the pattern fosters consistent families, it can create overhead in dynamic, ever-changing systems.

Used thoughtfully, =Abstract Factory= remains a powerful approach for ensuring that your software can handle multiple product suites with consistent internal logic. Let’s see how.

* 2. Conceptual Motivation

A classic example—often found in textbooks—entails developing a cross-platform UI library. For each supported operating system or “theme,” you need to produce objects like a =Button=, a =Checkbox=, or a =Window=. If the application picks a “WindowsFactory,” everything must look and behave like Windows widgets; if it picks a “LinuxFactory,” the widgets match the Linux style.

Take a similar concept to theming in web or mobile applications. You might have a “DarkThemeFactory” and a “LightThemeFactory,” each producing sets of UI components styled consistently. Or consider a data-driven system that interacts with multiple databases—some enterprise users might use Oracle, others might use PostgreSQL, still others might use an in-memory DB. An =Abstract Factory= can produce the corresponding DAOs, queries, or connection objects to ensure they all interoperate correctly for a given database family.

The hallmark is: multiple product types, each with different variants, but these variants must remain consistent across all product types once chosen.

* 3. Beginner Example (Python)

We’ll begin with a straightforward Python implementation that focuses on theming different UI elements. This scenario is deliberately simple to illustrate the structure of the pattern.

** 3.1 Motivating Scenario

Imagine a GUI library for a simplistic text editor or note-taking application. The application can use either a “Dark Theme” or a “Light Theme,” and each theme supplies consistent styling for a =Button= and a =Checkbox=. The core code that actually draws the UI elements should only call an abstract factory interface, letting the user or environment decide at runtime which concrete factory to instantiate.

** 3.2 Code Example (Beginner, in Python)

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# STEP 1: Define the product interfaces (Button, Checkbox)

class Button(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def render(self):
        pass

class Checkbox(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def toggle(self):
        pass

# STEP 2: Provide concrete product implementations for each theme

class DarkThemeButton(Button):
    def render(self):
        print("Rendering a button with Dark Theme")

class LightThemeButton(Button):
    def render(self):
        print("Rendering a button with Light Theme")

class DarkThemeCheckbox(Checkbox):
    def toggle(self):
        print("Toggling a checkbox with Dark Theme")

class LightThemeCheckbox(Checkbox):
    def toggle(self):
        print("Toggling a checkbox with Light Theme")

# STEP 3: Define the Abstract Factory interface

class ThemeFactory(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def create_button(self) -> Button:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def create_checkbox(self) -> Checkbox:
        pass

# STEP 4: Provide concrete factories for each theme

class DarkThemeFactory(ThemeFactory):
    def create_button(self) -> Button:
        return DarkThemeButton()

    def create_checkbox(self) -> Checkbox:
        return DarkThemeCheckbox()

class LightThemeFactory(ThemeFactory):
    def create_button(self) -> Button:
        return LightThemeButton()

    def create_checkbox(self) -> Checkbox:
        return LightThemeCheckbox()

# STEP 5: Client code that uses the factory
def build_ui(factory: ThemeFactory):
    button = factory.create_button()
    checkbox = factory.create_checkbox()

    button.render()
    checkbox.toggle()

# Demonstration
if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_prefers_dark = True

    if user_prefers_dark:
        theme_factory = DarkThemeFactory()
    else:
        theme_factory = LightThemeFactory()

    build_ui(theme_factory)
#+END_SRC

*** 3.2.1 Explanation

- =Product Interfaces=: =Button= and =Checkbox= are abstract base classes in Python, each with a single abstract method. They represent the family’s product types.

- =Concrete Products=: =DarkThemeButton= and =LightThemeButton= implement the =Button= interface; similarly for =DarkThemeCheckbox= and =LightThemeCheckbox=.

- =Abstract Factory Interface=: =ThemeFactory= declares methods for producing each product type. Notice the method signatures: =create_button()= returns a =Button=, and =create_checkbox()= returns a =Checkbox=.

- =Concrete Factories=: =DarkThemeFactory= and =LightThemeFactory= each produce the matching set of products. Once you pick =DarkThemeFactory=, you can only get dark-themed buttons and checkboxes from it.

- =Client=: The =build_ui= function demonstrates usage. It accepts any =ThemeFactory=, calls the creation methods, and interacts with the resulting objects without caring if they’re “dark” or “light.”

** 3.3 Observations

This example stays close to the canonical explanation of =Abstract Factory=: we have multiple product types (two, in this case) and two families. Notice how easy it is to add new product types (like a Slider) or new families (like a “ColorblindFriendlyThemeFactory”), as long as each factory method is mirrored across every concrete factory. The trade-off is that adding a new product type means updating the abstract factory interface and each concrete factory. That overhead is justified if consistent families are crucial and product variety is expected to grow.

* 4. Intermediate Example (Guile Scheme)

We now move to Guile Scheme to showcase the =Abstract Factory= in a functional or Lisp-like environment. Although Scheme is not primarily object-oriented, it supports lexical closures, dynamic dispatch, and even GOOPS (Guile’s Object-Oriented Programming System). We’ll illustrate a scenario dealing with different “report generators” that produce families of related objects—such as a “header” object and a “content block” object.

** 4.1 Motivating Scenario

Imagine you have a system that generates reports in multiple formats: one for web (HTML-based) and one for plain text. Each format will produce a “header block” and a “content block,” which differ in layout and styling. We want to ensure that once you choose the “HTML format,” the system uses an HTML header and an HTML content block. Similarly for “PlainText.”

** 4.2 Code Example (Intermediate, in Guile Scheme)

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;;; We will assume the presence of the (oop goops) library for object orientation.
(use-modules (oop goops))

;; Define classes for product interfaces: let's call them <report-header> and <report-content>.

(define-class <report-header> ()
  (virtual (render-header (self)) "Abstract method for rendering header"))

(define-class <report-content> ()
  (virtual (render-content (self) data) "Abstract method for rendering content"))

;; Concrete products for HTML:
(define-class <html-header> (<report-header>)
  (define (render-header (self))
    "<h1>HTML Report Header</h1>"))

(define-class <html-content> (<report-content>)
  (define (render-content (self) data)
    (string-append "<p>" data "</p>")))

;; Concrete products for PlainText:
(define-class <text-header> (<report-header>)
  (define (render-header (self))
    "=== TEXT REPORT HEADER ===\n"))

(define-class <text-content> (<report-content>)
  (define (render-content (self) data)
    (string-append data "\n")))

;; Now define an abstract factory class: <report-factory>.
(define-class <report-factory> ()
  (virtual (make-header (self)) "Creates a <report-header> object")
  (virtual (make-content (self)) "Creates a <report-content> object"))

;; Concrete factories:
(define-class <html-report-factory> (<report-factory>)
  (define (make-header (self))
    (make <html-header>))
  (define (make-content (self))
    (make <html-content>)))

(define-class <text-report-factory> (<report-factory>)
  (define (make-header (self))
    (make <text-header>))
  (define (make-content (self))
    (make <text-content>)))

;; Client code:
(define (generate-report factory data)
  (let* ((header (make-header factory))
         (content (make-content factory))
         (header-text (render-header header))
         (content-text (render-content content data)))
    (string-append header-text content-text)))

;; Example usage:
(let ((my-factory (make <html-report-factory>)))
  (display (generate-report my-factory "Some interesting data")))

(newline)

(let ((my-factory (make <text-report-factory>)))
  (display (generate-report my-factory "Some interesting data")))
(newline)
#+END_SRC

*** 4.2.1 Explanation

- =GOOPS Classes=: We define =<report-header>= and =<report-content>= as abstract classes with “virtual” methods in Guile Scheme. This effectively sets up an interface-like structure for rendering different parts of a report.

- =Concrete Products=: =<html-header>= and =<html-content>= produce HTML-based output, whereas =<text-header>= and =<text-content>= produce a text-based version.

- =Abstract Factory=: =<report-factory>= declares two virtual methods: =make-header= and =make-content=, each returning one of the above product types.

- =Concrete Factories=: =<html-report-factory>= and =<text-report-factory>= override those methods to produce the correct HTML or text classes.

- =Client Function=: =generate-report= expects a factory object, requests the relevant product objects, and composes them. It’s ignorant of whether it’s dealing with HTML or plain text. That knowledge lives inside the factory.

** 4.3 Observations

This example demonstrates how even in a Lisp-like language, we can mimic traditional OOP patterns. The “families” here are HTML vs. PlainText. Each family has two product types: a header and a content block. Once we pick an =<html-report-factory>=, we remain consistent in the choice of =<html-header>= and =<html-content>=.

* 5. Advanced Example (Rust)

For an advanced scenario, we’ll venture into Rust. We’ll create an =Abstract Factory= that produces “transport” objects for a hypothetical simulation. Suppose we want to simulate movement across different terrains: “Land” and “Water.” Each terrain might have multiple vehicles (or “transports”). But we also want our “family” to include an item for packaging cargo for that terrain. A “LandTransportFactory” might produce a “Truck” and “BoxContainer,” whereas a “WaterTransportFactory” might produce a “Boat” and “WaterproofContainer.”

** 5.1 Motivating Scenario

We imagine a shipping simulation library that deals with route planning and cargo packaging. If the user configures a route over land, we want a consistent set: land-based vehicles and containers. For water routes, we want water-based vehicles and waterproof containers. We also want concurrency safety, as multiple threads might build route simulations simultaneously.

** 5.2 Code Example (Advanced, in Rust)

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::fmt::Display;

// Step 1: Define traits for the two product types: TransportVehicle and CargoContainer
trait TransportVehicle: Send + Sync + Display {
    fn move_cargo(&self, cargo: &str);
}

trait CargoContainer: Send + Sync + Display {
    fn pack(&self, item: &str);
}

// Step 2: Provide concrete product implementations for Land
struct Truck;
impl TransportVehicle for Truck {
    fn move_cargo(&self, cargo: &str) {
        println!("Truck is moving cargo: {}", cargo);
    }
}
impl Display for Truck {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut std::fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "Truck")
    }

impl Display for BoxContainer {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut std::fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "BoxContainer")
    }
}

// Step 3: Provide concrete product implementations for Water
struct Boat;
impl TransportVehicle for Boat {
    fn move_cargo(&self, cargo: &str) {
        println!("Boat is moving cargo: {}", cargo);
    }
}
impl Display for Boat {

// Step 4: Define the Abstract Factory trait

    fn create_vehicle(&self) -> Arc<dyn TransportVehicle>;
    fn create_container(&self) -> Arc<dyn CargoContainer>;
    fn factory_name(&self) -> &str;

// Step 5: Concrete factories for Land and Water
struct LandTransportFactory;
impl TransportFactory for LandTransportFactory {
    fn create_vehicle(&self) -> Arc<dyn TransportVehicle> {
        Arc::new(Truck)
    }

    fn create_container(&self) -> Arc<dyn CargoContainer> {

        Arc::new(WaterproofContainer)
    }

    fn factory_name(&self) -> &str {
        "WaterTransportFactory"
    }
}

// Step 6: Simulate usage in a multi-threaded environment
fn simulate_shipping(factory: Arc<dyn TransportFactory>, cargo_list: Vec<String>) {
    let vehicle = factory.create_vehicle();
    let container = factory.create_container();

    println!("Using {} from {}", vehicle, factory.factory_name());
    println!("Using {} from {}", container, factory.factory_name());
    
    // Pack the cargo using multiple threads
    let container_arc = Arc::clone(&container);
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for cargo_item in cargo_list {
        let cont_clone = Arc::clone(&container_arc);
        let veh_clone = Arc::clone(&vehicle);
        let handle = std::thread::spawn(move || {
            cont_clone.pack(&cargo_item);
            veh_clone.move_cargo(&cargo_item);
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    // Wait for all threads to finish
    for h in handles {
        let _ = h.join();
    }

#+END_SRC

*** 5.2.1 Explanation

- =Product Traits=: We have two product types: =TransportVehicle= and =CargoContainer=. Each includes methods relevant to shipping simulation (=move_cargo= and =pack=, respectively).

- =Concrete Implementations=: For “land,” we define =Truck= and =BoxContainer=. For “water,” we define =Boat= and =WaterproofContainer=. Notice each struct implements the relevant trait(s) and can provide distinct behaviors.

- =Abstract Factory Trait=: =TransportFactory= declares two methods: =create_vehicle()= and =create_container()=, each returning =Arc<dyn ...>= references for thread safety and shared ownership. The =factory_name= helps us see which factory is in use.

- =Concrete Factories=: =LandTransportFactory= and =WaterTransportFactory= supply the correct product objects, ensuring consistency. Once you choose “Land,” you’re guaranteed to get a =Truck= and a =BoxContainer=.

- =Multi-threaded Usage=: The =simulate_shipping= function highlights concurrency. We spawn threads to pack and move cargo items concurrently, all referencing the same product objects (thanks to =Arc=). The abstract factory approach ensures we never mix water-based containers with land-based vehicles, preserving internal consistency.

** 5.3 Nuances

- =Arcs and Locks=: We rely on reference counting and thread-safety rules because we want multiple threads to manipulate the same “container” or “vehicle.” If the operations were more sophisticated (modifying shared state), we might need =Mutex= or other synchronization primitives.

- =Dynamic Dispatch=: By returning =Arc<dyn TransportVehicle>=, we allow the factory to pick any concrete type. The calling code only sees the =TransportVehicle= trait. This is a hallmark of abstract factory usage in Rust, albeit it can incur small runtime costs for dynamic dispatch.

- =Factory Pattern vs. Composition=: In Rust, the pattern stands out because the language is not typically inheritance-based, so factory methods use traits and dynamic dispatch. This keeps our design modular, letting us add new transport families without changing existing code.

* 6. Nuances, Variations, and Best Practices

** 6.1 Comparing to Factory Method

While =Factory Method= handles the creation of a single product type (with multiple variants), =Abstract Factory= orchestrates multiple product types as a family. It is common for =Abstract Factory= to use multiple =Factory Method=s internally—each method creates one product type. The difference is that =Abstract Factory= implies you always get matching sets of products from one chosen factory instance.

** 6.2 Handling Many Product Types

If you have a large family of products (like a big UI toolkit with 10+ widget types), implementing an =Abstract Factory= can involve a large interface. In strongly typed languages (e.g., Java, Rust), you might end up with a big “=createButton()=,” “=createLabel()=,” “=createTextField()=,” etc. This is correct for the pattern, but can be unwieldy if new widget types keep appearing. Some teams break it down into sub-factories or use partial or dynamic factories for more granular extension.

** 6.3 Extensibility Considerations

Adding a new product type means updating the abstract factory interface (e.g., adding a =create_slider()= method) and all existing factory subclasses. This can be a lot of overhead if new product types appear frequently. On the other hand, adding a new family (e.g., “=MacThemeFactory=” in a UI scenario) might be simpler: you only define the new factory class. Thus, =Abstract Factory= is best in stable systems where the set of product types is relatively stable, but new families are introduced as needed.

** 6.4 Avoiding Combinatorial Explosions

Sometimes, if you have many product families but each differs slightly, you risk a combinatorial explosion of factory classes. One can mitigate this by partially factoring out shared creation logic or by parameterizing certain aspects. Another approach is the “prototype-based” creation, where each factory holds references to sample (=prototype=) objects that it clones. This can unify the creation process while still preserving consistent families.

** 6.5 Recognizing Abstract Factory in the Wild

You often see “kit” or “factory set” classes in UI frameworks. For example, a =GUIFactory= that can produce both “=Window=” and “=Button=” objects. Or a “=DatabaseFactory=” that creates a “=Connection=” object and a “=Statement=” object that must match the database’s specifics. The pattern is also common in theming or skinning engines for games or software. If you notice code that always produces multiple related objects, possibly with the same “theme” or “style,” that strongly indicates an =Abstract Factory= usage.

** 6.6 Testing and Mocking

Testing an =Abstract Factory= can be simpler than you might think. You can supply a “TestFactory” that produces mock objects instead of real ones. This ensures your main logic (the client) can run unaffected, while you gather data on how the mock objects were used. On the other hand, a large interface can complicate the creation of stubs or mocks, since you must replicate multiple product creation methods.

** 6.7 Overuse and Alternatives

If you have only two product types, each with a handful of variants, or you rarely need to add new families, a simpler approach—like a single “Factory Method” or even a map-based creation function—might suffice. =Abstract Factory= truly shines when the system revolves around well-defined families that need consistent usage.

* 7. Real-World Usage

- =Cross-Platform GUIs=: A textbook case—creating consistent sets of widgets for Windows, Mac, Linux, or various theming systems.

- =Multiple Database Connectors=: For instance, a data access layer might produce a “=Connection=” and “=Command=” object. Each database family (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle) must produce a matching set of these objects.

- =Game Engines with Theming or Level Types=: You might have a “ForestLevelFactory” that produces “Tree” objects and “Rock” objects, while a “DesertLevelFactory” produces “Cactus” objects and “SandDune” objects, ensuring that the environment remains coherent.

- =Plugin Ecosystems=: If each plugin must supply a family of related functionalities (like multiple types of hooks, UI panels, or data formats), an =Abstract Factory= might orchestrate that consistency.

* 8. Conclusion

The =Abstract Factory= pattern is one of the most structured and recognizable in object-oriented design. It solves the problem of creating consistent families of objects by encapsulating their instantiation in a dedicated factory object (or set of objects), ensuring that once you choose a specific “family,” you get only the matching set of product instances.

Through three examples—Python (thematic UI), Guile Scheme (report generation), and Rust (shipping simulation)—we’ve seen how the pattern transcends language boundaries. Its core remains the same: define multiple product types, define an abstract factory that can produce each product type, and then implement concrete factories that bundle these products into consistent families.

From a practical standpoint, the =Abstract Factory= fosters clean architecture by compartmentalizing creation logic. It can, however, introduce overhead: a new product type or a new method in the abstract factory interface requires changes to all concrete factory classes. If you anticipate many new product types daily, a simpler approach might be preferable. But in a stable system where you might add new families occasionally, the =Abstract Factory= provides a robust structure that helps maintain a cohesive design. It keeps your code open to new product families—whether they be new themes, new operating systems, or new environment connectors—while minimizing the impact on existing code. And that, ultimately, is the essence of a well-applied design pattern: balancing flexibility and clarity, without sacrificing the maintainability of your software ecosystem.
