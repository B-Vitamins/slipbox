The [[id:f4f1d422-4428-4cf5-9b48-914891b38f39][stability condition]] for a [[id:39fcc45a-9b91-42f9-9960-19eab99aae83][thermodynamic]] system is given by

\[
\boxed{
\delta T \, \delta S+\sum_{i} \delta J_{i} \, \delta x_{i}+\sum_{\alpha} \delta \mu_{\alpha} \, \delta N_{\alpha}>0
}
\]

* Stability Condition in Thermodynamic Systems

The condition above holds under constant \(E, \mathbf{x}\), and \(\mathbf{N}\) constraints, and is symmetric across different sets of constraints. For variations in \(\delta T\) and \(\delta \mathbf{x}\) with \(\delta \mathbf{N} = 0\):

\begin{aligned}
\delta S &= (\partial_{T} S)_{\mathbf{x}} \delta T + (\partial_{x_{i}} S)_{T} \delta x_{i} \\
\delta J_{i} &= (\partial_{T} J_{i})_{\mathbf{x}} \delta T + (\partial_{x_{j}} J_{i})_{T} \delta x_{j}
\end{aligned}

Substituting these into the stability condition:

\[
(\partial_{T} S)_{\mathbf{x}} (\delta T)^{2} + (\partial_{x_{j}} J_{i})_{T} \delta x_{i} \delta x_{j} \geq 0
\]

The cross terms \(\delta T \delta x_{i}\) cancel due to Maxwell relations, leading to a quadratic form which must be positive for all \(\delta T\) and \(\delta \mathbf{x}\). 

For \(\delta T \neq 0\), we obtain \((\partial_{T} S)_{\mathbf{x}} \geq 0\), implying positive heat capacity:

\[
C_{\mathbf{x}} = \left(\frac{\mathrm{d} Q}{\mathrm{d} T}\right)_{\mathbf{x}} = T (\partial_{T} S)_{\mathbf{x}} \geq 0
\]

For \(\delta x_{i} \neq 0\), the corresponding response function \((\partial_{J_{i}} x_{i})_{T, x_{j \neq i}}\) must be positive. More generally, the matrix \((\partial_{x_{j}} J_{i})_{T}\) must be positive definite, implying all eigenvalues are positive.

Including chemical work for a gas, the relevant matrix is:

\begin{pmatrix}
-(\partial_{V} P)_{T, N} & -(\partial_{N} P)_{T, V} \\
(\partial_{V} \mu)_{T, N} & (\partial_{N} \mu)_{T, V}
\end{pmatrix}

Positive definiteness requires the determinant:

\[
(\partial_{N} P)_{T, V} (\partial_{V} \mu)_{T, N} - (\partial_{V} P)_{T, N} (\partial_{N} \mu)_{T, V} \geq 0
\]

* Stability Condition at Criticality

At the critical point, \((\partial_{V} P)_{T_{c}, N}=0\). Expanding the critical isotherm:

\[
\delta P (T=T_{c}) = (\partial_{V} P)_{T_{c}, N} \delta V + \frac{1}{2} (\partial_{V}^{2} P)_{T_{c}, N} \delta V^{2} + \frac{1}{6} (\partial_{V}^{3} P)_{T_{c}, N} \delta V^{3} + \cdots
\]

The condition \(-\delta P \delta V \geq 0\) implies \((\partial_{V}^{2} P)_{T_{c}, N} = 0\), and the third derivative must be negative if the first derivative vanishes. This helps determine the critical point from isotherm approximations, such as with the van der Waals equation, though a Taylor expansion is usually not justified.
