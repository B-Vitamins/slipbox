*Heat capacities* are obtained from the change in temperature upon addition of heat to the system.

Since heat is not a function of state, the path by which it is supplied must also be specified. For a gas we can calculate 

1) the heat capacities at *constant volume*, denoted by \(C_{V}=\mathrm{đ} Q /\left.\mathrm{d} T\right|_{V}\)

\[
C_{V}=\left.\frac{\mathrm{đ} Q}{\mathrm{~d} T}\right|_{V}=\left.\frac{\mathrm{d} E-\mathrm{đ} W}{\mathrm{~d} T}\right|_{V}=\left.\frac{\mathrm{d} E+P \mathrm{~d} V}{\mathrm{~d} T}\right|_{V}=(\partial_T E)_{V}. \tag{1}
\]

2) the heat capacities at constant pressure, denoted by \(C_{V}=\mathrm{đ} Q /\left.\mathrm{d} T\right|_{P}\)

\[
C_{P}=\left.\frac{\mathrm{đ} Q}{\mathrm{~d} T}\right|_{P}=\left.\frac{\mathrm{d} E-\mathrm{đ} W}{\mathrm{~d} T}\right|_{P}=\left.\frac{\mathrm{d} E+P \mathrm{~d} V}{\mathrm{~d} T}\right|_{P}=(\partial_T E)_{P} + P (\partial_T V)_{P}. \tag{2}
\]

The latter is larger since some of the heat is used up in the work done in changes of volume.

Since the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature (see [[id:05bb8f90-36b7-4593-8c20-de0f1b87578e][Joule's free expansion experiment]] or [[id:226a1cb5-6511-491a-baf7-c59bcd6891d1][Equations of state]]), \((\partial_T E)_{V} = (\partial_T E)_{P}=\mathrm{D}_T E\), and (2) simplifies to

\[
C_{P} - C_{V} = P (\partial_T V)_{P} = P V \alpha_{P} = \frac{P V}{T} \equiv N k_{B}.
\]

The last equality follows from [[id:8bff36e1-8fd3-48aa-88ba-8b508a8cdd86][extensivity]]: for a given amount of ideal gas, the constant \(P V / T\) is proportional to \(N\), the number of particles in the gas; the ratio is [[id:f4efabf0-abdd-4ab1-9605-89957ce79e09][Boltzmann's constant]] with a value of \(k_{B} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{JK}^{-1}\).
