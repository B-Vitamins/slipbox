1) Since \(S(T=0, \mathbf{X})=0\) for all coordinates \(\mathbf{X}\),

\[
\lim_{T \rightarrow 0}(\partial_{\mathbf{X}} S)_{T} = 0
\]

2) [[id:7da7f949-a4cb-4953-8e91-00f359d37c9c][Heat capacities]] must vanish as \(T \rightarrow 0\) since

\[
S(T, \mathbf{X})-S(0, \mathbf{X})=\int_{0}^{T} \mathrm{~d} T^{\prime} \frac{C_{\mathbf{X}}\left(T^{\prime}\right)}{T^{\prime}}
\]

and the integral diverges as \(T \rightarrow 0\) unless

\[
\lim _{T \rightarrow 0} C_{\mathbf{X}}(T)=0
\]

3) [[id:9e70012e-f1f6-4610-b9d2-c80fb92a7e1d][Thermal responses]] such as the *thermal expansivities* also vanish as \(T \rightarrow 0\) since

\[
\alpha_{J}=\left.\frac{1}{x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial T}\right|_{J}=\left.\frac{1}{x} \frac{\partial S}{\partial J}\right|_{T}
\]

The second equality follows from the [[id:9a34714f-f07c-4f3f-9067-7a90d32fd20d][Maxwell relation]] \( (\partial_{J} S)_{T} = (\partial_{T} x)_{J} \). The vanishing of the latter is guaranteed by \(\lim_{T \rightarrow 0}(\partial_{\mathbf{X}} S)_{T} = 0\). 


4) It is impossible to cool any system to absolute zero temperature in a finite number of steps.

For example, we can cool a gas by an adiabatic reduction in pressure. Since the curves of \(S\) versus \(T\) for different pressures must join at \(T=0\), successive steps involve progressively smaller changes, in \(S\) and in \(T\), on approaching zero temperature. Alternatively, that zero temperatures is unattainable implies that \(S(T=0, P)\) is independent of \(P\). This is a weaker statement of the third law, which also implies the equality of zero temperature entropy for different substances.
