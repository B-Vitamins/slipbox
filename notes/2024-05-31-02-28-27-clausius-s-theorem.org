*Clausius's theorem* is a statement about total [[id:5211418e-55fa-4d7e-b2f5-88148f84cc76][heat]] increments supplied to a system at [[id:73293bf4-e866-4339-ad08-4258cebfb93f][temperature]] \( T \) during a [[id:aaccea55-c4f1-4617-a44f-8157cb500546][cyclic transformation]]. The existence of a [[id:df6bf294-bc8a-441f-b16a-02fe248d59a9][state function]] named [[id:b91504dd-9976-4ae9-bdfb-4f92903ee24c][entropy]] is a consequence of Clausius's theorem.

#+NAME: Clausius's theorem
#+begin_theorem latex
For any cyclic transformation (reversible or not), \(\oint \mathrm{đ} Q / T \leq 0\), where \(\mathrm{đ} Q\) is the heat increment supplied to the system at temperature \(T\).
#+end_theorem

The proof of Clausius's theorem relies on

#+NAME: Clausius's theorem
#+begin_proof latex
+ Subdivide the cycle into a series of infinitesimal transformations (not necessarily quasi-static) in which the system receives energy in the form of heat \(\mathrm{đ} Q\) and work \(\mathrm{đ} W\).
+ Direct all the heat exchanges of the system to one port of a Carnot engine, which has another reservoir at a fixed temperature \(T_{0}\). 
+ Since the sign of \(\mathrm{đ} Q\) is not specified, the Carnot engine must operate a series of infinitesimal cycles in either direction.
+ To deliver heat \(\mathrm{đ} Q\) to the system at some stage, the engine has to extract heat \(\mathrm{đ} Q_{R}\) from the fixed reservoir. If the heat is delivered to a part of the system that is locally at a temperature \(T\), then according to

\begin{align*}
1-\eta\left(T_{1}, T_{2}\right) = \frac{Q_{2}}{Q_{1}} \equiv \frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}},
\end{align*}

\[
\mathrm{đ} Q_{R}=T_{0} \frac{\mathrm{đ} Q}{T}.
\]

+ After the cycle is completed, the system and the Carnot engine return to their original states. The net effect of the combined process is extracting heat \(Q_{R}=\oint \mathrm{đ} Q_R\) from the reservoir and converting it to external work \(W\).
+ The work \(W=Q_{R}\) is the sum total of the work elements done by the Carnot engine, and the work performed by the system in the complete cycle.
+ By Kelvin's statement of the second law, \(Q_{R}=W \leq 0\), that is,

\[
T_{0} \oint \frac{\text { đQ }}{T} \leq 0, \quad \Longrightarrow \oint \frac{\text { đQ }}{T} \leq 0 \tag{1}
\]

since \(T_{0}>0\).

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
Note that \(T\) in (1) above refers to the temperature of the whole system only for quasi-static processes in which it can be uniquely defined throughout the cycle. Otherwise, it is just a local temperature (say at a boundary of the system) at which the Carnot engine deposits the element of heat.
