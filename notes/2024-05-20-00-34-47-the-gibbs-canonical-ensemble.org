Our starting point in [[id:39fcc45a-9b91-42f9-9960-19eab99aae83][thermodynamics]] was a mechanically and adiabatically isolated system which specified a [[id:d351a06e-42c5-4a72-98c9-bbfe8f40afe7][macrostate]] \(M \equiv(E, \mathbf{x})\). The corresponding set of mixed [[id:2b3acff9-a43f-4fc5-92d8-a1296fb3f0f7][microstates]] formed the [[id:170f5ef3-3995-4720-bbdb-c2ca704f0739][the microcanonical ensemble]].

We then allowed the input of [[id:5211418e-55fa-4d7e-b2f5-88148f84cc76][heat]] into the system but no external work. The system \(S\) was maintained at a constant [[id:73293bf4-e866-4339-ad08-4258cebfb93f][temperature]] through contact with a reservoir \(\mathrm{R}\). The reservoir is another macroscopic system that is sufficiently large so that its temperature is not changed due to interactions with \(\mathrm{S}\). In this setup, the [[id:73293bf4-e866-4339-ad08-4258cebfb93f][temperature]] \( T \) and the generalized coordinates \(\mathbf{x}\), were fixed, which specified a [[id:d351a06e-42c5-4a72-98c9-bbfe8f40afe7][macrostate]] \(M \equiv(T, \mathbf{x})\). The corresponding set of mixed [[id:2b3acff9-a43f-4fc5-92d8-a1296fb3f0f7][microstates]] formed the [[id:d0ef6177-22a7-45e9-a756-ee12186d4eef][the canonical ensemble]].

We now allowed the input of both [[id:5211418e-55fa-4d7e-b2f5-88148f84cc76][heat]] and work into the system. The system \(S\) is maintained at a constant [[id:73293bf4-e866-4339-ad08-4258cebfb93f][temperature]] through contact with a reservoir \(\mathrm{R}\). The reservoir is another macroscopic system that is sufficiently large so that its temperature is not changed due to interactions with \(\mathrm{S}\). In addition, the system \( S \) is maintained at a fixed force \( \mathbf{J} \). In this setup, the [[id:73293bf4-e866-4339-ad08-4258cebfb93f][temperature]] \( T \) and the constant external force \( \mathbf{J} \) are fixed, which specifies a [[id:d351a06e-42c5-4a72-98c9-bbfe8f40afe7][macrostate]] \(M \equiv(T, \mathbf{J})\). The thermodynamic coordinates \(\mathbf{x}\) appear as additional [[id:fa0e3aa2-347e-48b9-9cb7-e9f0be897281][random variables]]. The corresponding set of mixed [[id:2b3acff9-a43f-4fc5-92d8-a1296fb3f0f7][microstates]] form [[id:689182a6-51d4-4cd4-b941-5d07e52f8fe9][the Gibbs canonical ensemble]].

#+CAPTION: The system can be maintained at a temperature T through heat exchanges with a reservoir, and maintained at a fixed force J.

During [[id:5211418e-55fa-4d7e-b2f5-88148f84cc76][heat]] input at constant temperature and work input at constant external force \( \mathbf{J} \), the [[id:73293bf4-e866-4339-ad08-4258cebfb93f][temperature]] \( T \) and the constant external force \( \mathbf{J} \) are fixed, which specifies a [[id:d351a06e-42c5-4a72-98c9-bbfe8f40afe7][macrostate]] \(M \equiv(T, \mathbf{J})\).

The corresponding set of mixed [[id:2b3acff9-a43f-4fc5-92d8-a1296fb3f0f7][microstate]] forms Gibbs canonical ensemble (see [[id:bccee305-db73-49bb-a1e5-6379e80dd980][pure states and mixed states]] and [[id:21d62749-69ab-4e25-b366-eb6ff17a2f09][phase space density]]). The thermodynamic coordinates \(\mathbf{x}\) appear as additional [[id:fa0e3aa2-347e-48b9-9cb7-e9f0be897281][random variables]].

Including the work done against the forces, the energy of the combined system that includes these elements is \(H-\mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{x}\). Note that while the work done on the system is \(+\mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{x}\), the energy change associated with the external elements with coordinates \(\mathbf{x}\) has the opposite sign.

The [[id:45b01b6e-984e-446f-a87f-14cdaabd0ed3][principle of maximum entropy]] provide unbiased estimates of the /equilibrium probability distribution/ \(p_{(T,\,\mathbf{J})} \left(\mu_{\mathrm{S}},\,\mathbf{x}\right)\) constrained by the /average energy/ of the combined system for the (Gibbs) *canonical ensemble*:

\[
\boxed{
p\left(\mu_{\mathrm{S}}, \mathbf{x}\right)=\exp \left(-\beta H\left(\mu_{\mathrm{S}}\right)+\beta \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{x}\right) / \mathcal{Z}(T, N, \mathbf{J}), \qquad \mathcal{Z}(N, T, \mathbf{J})= \sum_{\mu_{\mathrm{S}},\,\mathbf{x}} \exp \left(-\beta H\left(\mu_{\mathrm{S}}\right)+\beta \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{x}\right)
}
\]

where \( \mathcal{Z}(N, T, \mathbf{J}) \) is the *Gibbs partition function*.
