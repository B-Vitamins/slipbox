*Force constants* measure the (infinitesimal) ratio of displacement to force and are generalizations of the spring constant. As examples, we have

1) *isothermal compressibility of a gas* 

\[\kappa_{T} = - V^{-1} (\partial_P V)_{T} \]

2) *susceptibility of a magnet* 

\[\chi_{T} = V^{-1} (\partial_B M)_{T}\]

From the [[id:226a1cb5-6511-491a-baf7-c59bcd6891d1][Equation of state]] of an ideal gas \(P V \propto T\), we obtain its isothermal compressibility \(\kappa_{T}=1 / P\).
