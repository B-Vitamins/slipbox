#+TITLE: Bridge Pattern
#+FILETAGS: :concept:
#+SETUPFILE: ~/.config/emacs/setup/setupfile.org

* 1. Introduction and Historical Context
The Bridge pattern belongs to the set of structural design patterns in object-oriented paradigms, placing it alongside patterns like Adapter, Composite, and Facade. It offers a way to decouple an abstraction from its implementation, allowing each to vary independently. More concretely, when you have a class hierarchy for abstractions (like shapes) and another class hierarchy for implementations (like rendering backends), you risk a combinatorial explosion if you embed them in a single inheritance structure (e.g., ==VectorCircle==, ==RasterCircle==, ==VectorSquare==, ==RasterSquare==, etc.). By introducing a “bridge,” you separate these dimensions—abstraction vs. implementation—so they can evolve or expand without forcing one dimension to balloon in lockstep with the other.

Historically, the pattern gained attention in GUI toolkits and cross-platform libraries. Developers frequently needed to support multiple rendering strategies or operating system APIs without duplicating every possible combination in subclass after subclass. The Bridge provided an elegant solution: define your abstraction (the “front-end” interface) separately from the platform- or style-specific implementation, with a small linking mechanism in between.

** 1.1 Why Use Bridge?
- Multiple Dimensions of Variation: If you have two (or more) major axes of change—like “type of shape” and “rendering style”—the Bridge pattern ensures you don’t spawn an unmanageably large inheritance hierarchy.
- Looser Coupling: By assigning the “implementation” to a distinct hierarchy or interface, you reduce the direct dependencies in your abstraction code. This fosters better testability and maintainability.
- Run-time Flexibility: In some contexts, the abstraction might change its implementation at runtime (e.g., switching from software rendering to hardware-accelerated rendering). With a Bridge, such a swap is easier to accomplish.

** 1.2 Potential Pitfalls
- Overengineering: If you only have a single dimension of variation—or you do not anticipate the need to swap or extend implementations—introducing a Bridge might complicate the design unnecessarily.
- Indirection: The Bridge inevitably adds another layer of indirection. That can occasionally hamper debugging or introduce a small performance cost. Usually, these overheads are modest, but they’re worth noting.
- Parallel Class Hierarchies: The pattern essentially sets up parallel hierarchies (one for abstractions, one for implementations). If not documented carefully, it can confuse new developers on the team.

When used appropriately, the Bridge pattern elegantly tames complexity and fosters architectural agility.

* 2. Conceptual Motivation
One of the canonical illustrations for Bridge is shapes and rendering backends. You might have shapes like ==Circle==, ==Square==, ==Triangle==, each potentially drawn with ==Raster== or ==Vector== rendering. Without a Bridge, a naive approach might lead to a combinatorial set of concrete classes—==RasterCircle==, ==RasterSquare==, ==RasterTriangle==, ==VectorCircle==, ==VectorSquare==, ==VectorTriangle==, etc. If you add more shapes or more rendering styles, the matrix grows even larger.

Instead, the Bridge pattern says: separate the shape (the abstraction) from the rendering approach (the implementation). Each shape references a renderer interface, delegating the “how” of drawing to that interface, while the shape’s code focuses on the “what” (i.e., geometry, position, etc.). That is the essence of bridging: any shape can pair with any renderer at runtime, each evolving independently.

* 3. Beginner Example (Python)
** 3.1 Motivating Scenario
You’re building a mini-graphics library that supports two rendering techniques:

- ASCII Renderer: Draw shapes as simple ASCII text in a console.
- SVG Renderer: Output shapes in an SVG-like format for browsers.

Simultaneously, you want to define shapes (like ==Circle== or ==Rectangle==) that can be displayed in either renderer. We’ll show how the Bridge pattern elegantly avoids combinatorial explosion.

** 3.2 Code Example (Beginner, Python)
#+BEGIN_SRC python
class Renderer:
    """Implementation interface that declares methods for rendering shapes."""
    def render_circle(self, x, y, radius):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def render_rectangle(self, x, y, width, height):
        raise NotImplementedError

class AsciiRenderer(Renderer):
    def render_circle(self, x, y, radius):
        print(f"Drawing a circle at ({x}, {y}) with radius {radius} in ASCII")

    def render_rectangle(self, x, y, width, height):
        print(f"Drawing a rectangle at ({x}, {y}) with width {width} and height {height} in ASCII")

class SvgRenderer(Renderer):
    def render_circle(self, x, y, radius):
        print(f\"<circle cx='{x}' cy='{y}' r='{radius}' />\")

    def render_rectangle(self, x, y, width, height):
        print(f\"<rect x='{x}' y='{y}' width='{width}' height='{height}' />\")

class Shape:
    """Abstraction class that maintains a reference to an implementation of Renderer."""
    def __init__(self, renderer: Renderer):
        self.renderer = renderer

    def draw(self):
        raise NotImplementedError

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, renderer: Renderer, x, y, radius):
        super().__init__(renderer)
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.radius = radius

    def draw(self):
        self.renderer.render_circle(self.x, self.y, self.radius)

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, renderer: Renderer, x, y, width, height):
        super().__init__(renderer)
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def draw(self):
        self.renderer.render_rectangle(self.x, self.y, self.width, self.height)

# Usage example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ascii_renderer = AsciiRenderer()
    svg_renderer = SvgRenderer()

    circle_ascii = Circle(ascii_renderer, 10, 20, 5)
    circle_svg = Circle(svg_renderer, 10, 20, 5)

    rect_ascii = Rectangle(ascii_renderer, 0, 0, 10, 4)
    rect_svg = Rectangle(svg_renderer, 0, 0, 10, 4)

    circle_ascii.draw()
    circle_svg.draw()
    rect_ascii.draw()
    rect_svg.draw()
#+END_SRC

*** 3.2.1 Explanation
- ==Renderer== Interface: Declares methods for rendering circles, rectangles, etc. This is the implementation side of the Bridge.
- Concrete Renderers: ==AsciiRenderer==, ==SvgRenderer== each implement how to draw shapes in their respective mediums.
- ==Shape== Abstraction: Declares a reference to a renderer. Each shape delegates the actual “draw” logic to ==renderer==, ensuring the shape doesn’t need to know the rendering details.
- Concrete Shapes: ==Circle==, ==Rectangle== store geometry but call ==renderer.render_circle(...)== or ==renderer.render_rectangle(...)== to do the actual drawing.
- Usage: We can mix shapes with any renderer. We avoid creating separate classes for each shape-renderer combination, thus maintaining a neat, flexible design.

** 3.3 Observations
This beginner-level example is the canonical usage of Bridge. It’s enough to illustrate how bridging the shape dimension with the renderer dimension prevents an overly complex inheritance tree. It also highlights how you can add a new shape or a new renderer without altering existing code outside of that dimension.

* 4. Intermediate Example (Guile Scheme)
** 4.1 Motivating Scenario
Imagine you have a system that generates reports. These reports might come in multiple “abstractions” (like a short summary report vs. a detailed analysis report). Meanwhile, the output “implementation” might vary between:

- Plain text output.
- LaTeX output for fancy formatting.

We want to avoid replicating each type of report with each output method. A Bridge can separate the “report abstraction” from the “output approach.”

** 4.2 Code Example (Intermediate, Guile Scheme)
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(use-modules (oop goops))

;; 1) Define the "implementation" interface for output, i.e. <output-impl>
(define-class <output-impl> ()
  (virtual (write-title (self title)) 
           "Write the title string")
  (virtual (write-paragraph (self text))
           "Write a paragraph of text"))

;; 2) Concrete implementations: plain text vs. LaTeX

(define-class <plain-text-output> (<output-impl>)
  (define (write-title (self) title)
    (display "=== ") (display title) (display " ===\n\n"))
  (define (write-paragraph (self) text)
    (display text) (display "\n\n")))

(define-class <latex-output> (<output-impl>)
  (define (write-title (self) title)
    (display (string-append "\\section*{" title "}\n\n")))
  (define (write-paragraph (self) text)
    (display (string-append text "\n\n"))))

;; 3) The "abstraction" class hierarchy for reports:
(define-class <report> ()
  (slot output 'init-keyword #f) ;; We'll store a reference to <output-impl>
  (virtual (generate (self)) "Generate the report"))

;; 4) Two distinct report types: short summary vs. detailed
(define-class <summary-report> (<report>)
  (define (generate (self))
    (write-title (slot-ref self 'output) "Summary Report")
    (write-paragraph (slot-ref self 'output) "This is a brief summary.")))

(define-class <detailed-report> (<report>)
  (define (generate (self))
    (write-title (slot-ref self 'output) "Detailed Report")
    (write-paragraph (slot-ref self 'output) "Long description...")
    (write-paragraph (slot-ref self 'output) "Further details...")))

;; Example usage:
(let* ((plain-output (make <plain-text-output>))
       (latex-output (make <latex-output>))
       (short-report (make <summary-report> (output plain-output)))
       (long-report-latex (make <detailed-report> (output latex-output))))
  (generate short-report)
  (newline)
  (generate long-report-latex))
#+END_SRC

*** 4.2.1 Explanation
- ==<output-impl>==: The base “implementation” class. In a more typical OOP setting, we’d call it an interface or abstract class. We define virtual methods like ==write-title== and ==write-paragraph==.
- Concrete Output Classes: ==<plain-text-output>== and ==<latex-output>== provide the actual “implementation” on how text is formatted and displayed.
- ==<report>==: The “abstraction” base class, which holds a slot for output, referencing a ==<output-impl>== object. It also has a virtual ==generate== method.
- Concrete Reports: ==<summary-report>== and ==<detailed-report>== each override ==generate==, describing what they print, but not how they print it. Instead, they delegate to the implementation’s methods.
- Usage: We create a ==summary-report== that references ==plain-output==, and a ==detailed-report== that references ==latex-output==. Each can produce output in its assigned style. We can easily create new reports or new output implementations without duplicating everything crosswise.

** 4.3 Observations
This demonstrates how the Bridge concept is language-agnostic. Even though Scheme uses GOOPS for object orientation and has different syntax, the principle holds: the report (abstraction) is decoupled from the output (implementation). If you add a new ==MarkdownOutput== or a new ==FinancialReport==, you can pair them at runtime with minimal fuss.

* 5. Advanced Example (Rust)
** 5.1 Motivating Scenario
For an advanced scenario, we’ll use Rust, incorporating concurrency and dynamic dispatch. We’ll imagine a notification system that sends messages (the “abstraction”), while the actual transmission mechanism (email vs. SMS) is the “implementation.” The Bridge ensures we can swap or add new channels without rewriting the core message logic.

You have an enterprise notification system that can send alerts, warnings, or general announcements. Each alert type might structure messages differently. Meanwhile, the system must support multiple “transports” like Email, SMS, Slack, etc. The Bridge pattern will let us define different alerts (abstractions) independently from how they’re transmitted (implementations).

** 5.2 Code Example (Advanced, Rust)
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

// 1) The "implementation" trait
trait NotifierImpl: Send + Sync {
    fn send_message(&self, recipient: &str, subject: &str, body: &str);
}

// 2) Concrete implementations
struct EmailNotifier {
    smtp_server: String,
}

impl NotifierImpl for EmailNotifier {
    fn send_message(&self, recipient: &str, subject: &str, body: &str) {
        println!(
            "Sending EMAIL via {} to {} with subject '{}' and body '{}'",
            self.smtp_server, recipient, subject, body
        );
    }
}

struct SmsNotifier {
    service_url: String,
}

impl NotifierImpl for SmsNotifier {
    fn send_message(&self, recipient: &str, subject: &str, body: &str) {
        println!(
            "Sending SMS via {} to {}: ({} - {})",
            self.service_url, recipient, subject, body
        );
    }
}

// 3) The "abstraction" trait
trait Alert {
    fn notify(&self, recipient: &str);
}

// 4) A struct that pairs an "Alert" with a NotifierImpl
// This is effectively the 'bridge' linking the abstraction to the implementation
struct AlertBridge<T: NotifierImpl> {
    notifier: Arc<T>,
}

// 5) Concrete alert types
struct SystemAlert {
    title: String,
    message: String,
}

impl SystemAlert {
    fn new(title: &str, message: &str) -> Self {
        SystemAlert {
            title: title.to_string(),
            message: message.to_string(),
        }
    }
}

impl<T: NotifierImpl + 'static> Alert for (AlertBridge<T>, SystemAlert) {
    fn notify(&self, recipient: &str) {
        let (bridge, alert) = self;
        bridge.notifier.send_message(recipient, &alert.title, &alert.message);
    }
}

struct AdminAlert {
    severity: u8,
    details: String,
}

impl AdminAlert {
    fn new(severity: u8, details: &str) -> Self {
        AdminAlert {
            severity,
            details: details.to_string(),
        }
    }
}

impl<T: NotifierImpl + 'static> Alert for (AlertBridge<T>, AdminAlert) {
    fn notify(&self, recipient: &str) {
        let (bridge, alert) = self;
        let subject = format!("Admin Alert (Severity {})", alert.severity);
        bridge.notifier.send_message(recipient, &subject, &alert.details);
    }
}

// 6) Example usage
fn main() {
    let email_notifier = Arc::new(EmailNotifier {
        smtp_server: "smtp.example.com".to_string(),
    });
    let sms_notifier = Arc::new(SmsNotifier {
        service_url: "https://sms.gateway.org".to_string(),
    });

    // Create bridges for each implementation
    let email_bridge = AlertBridge {
        notifier: Arc::clone(&email_notifier),
    };
    let sms_bridge = AlertBridge {
        notifier: Arc::clone(&sms_notifier),
    };

    // Different alerts
    let system_alert = SystemAlert::new("System Overload", "CPU usage at 95%!");
    let admin_alert = AdminAlert::new(2, "Critical security patch required");

    // We can easily combine them
    let system_alert_email = (email_bridge, system_alert);
    let admin_alert_sms = (sms_bridge, admin_alert);

    // Now we can call notify
    system_alert_email.notify("user@example.com");
    admin_alert_sms.notify("555-1234");
}

*** 5.2.1 Explanation
- ==NotifierImpl== Trait: The implementation side of the Bridge. Classes like ==EmailNotifier== and ==SmsNotifier== each implement ==send_message(...)==.
- Concrete Implementations: ==EmailNotifier== and ==SmsNotifier== define how messages are actually transmitted, referencing an SMTP server or an SMS gateway.
- ==Alert== Trait: The abstraction side. This trait declares a method ==notify(&self, recipient: &str)==. Different alert “types” can implement it to structure messages differently.
- ==AlertBridge<T>==: This structure holds an ==Arc<T>== where ==T== implements ==NotifierImpl==. We rely on generics and dynamic references so multiple threads could share the same implementation if needed.
- Concrete Alert Types: ==SystemAlert== and ==AdminAlert== store data relevant to each alert. They implement ==Alert== in a slightly unusual way: we define ==Alert== for the tuple ==(AlertBridge<T>, SystemAlert)== or ==(AlertBridge<T>, AdminAlert)==. This approach leverages Rust’s trait system, demonstrating how the shape of the “abstraction object” can be formed by pairing the alert data with the bridge.
- Usage: We instantiate notifiers, build bridging structs, then create our alert objects. Each alert calls ==notify()==, which delegates to ==send_message()== on the underlying ==NotifierImpl==.

** 5.3 Observations
While somewhat more complex than a typical OOP approach, the code showcases how the Bridge concept adapts to Rust’s trait-based design. We separate the “notification logic” (which can have many subtypes, each forming a variant of ==Alert==) from the “transmission logic” (==NotifierImpl==). Adding a new alert type or a new transmission method becomes straightforward—no combinatorial explosion or rewriting needed.

* 6. Nuances, Variations, and Best Practices
** 6.1 When to Use Bridge vs. Other Patterns
- Bridge vs. Adapter: Adapter focuses on reconciling incompatible interfaces, typically to reuse old or external code. Bridge specifically aims to avoid a combinatorial inheritance explosion by splitting an abstraction from its implementation.
- Bridge vs. Strategy: Strategy typically deals with choosing one algorithm among many for a single responsibility. Bridge, however, is about decoupling two class hierarchies so that either can be extended independently.
- Bridge vs. Abstract Factory: Abstract Factory is about creating families of related objects. Bridge is about splitting an abstraction from its implementation. They can appear together if you’re building multiple abstract products that each rely on a shared set of implementations.

** 6.2 Parallel Hierarchies
A hallmark of the Bridge pattern is the creation of “parallel hierarchies.” One side is the “Abstraction” hierarchy, and the other is the “Implementation” hierarchy. For instance, you might have:

- Shapes (==Circle==, ==Rectangle==, ==Triangle==)
- Renderers (==Raster==, ==Vector==, ==ASCII==, ==SVG==)

Once you adopt a Bridge, you typically see these as two separate trees of classes, joined at runtime. You must be mindful of naming conventions, code organization, and documentation to keep track of each side and the bridging class or reference that unifies them.

** 6.3 Performance Considerations
The Bridge adds an extra level of indirection, which can be negligible or occasionally relevant in performance-critical code. If you’re frequently calling a bridging method in tight loops, you might want to ensure your language can optimize away some overhead, or consider direct calls if the performance difference is meaningful. In practice, most modern compilers and runtime environments handle these abstractions efficiently.

** 6.4 Changing Implementations at Runtime
One advantage of Bridge is that you can swap implementations (the “back end”) at runtime. For instance, a shape might start with a ==RasterRenderer==, then you switch it to ==VectorRenderer== when the user toggles a preference. As long as your bridging reference can be reassigned, the object’s abstraction remains intact, but the underlying “implementation” changes.

** 6.5 Testing a Bridge
From a testing perspective:
- Mocking the Implementation: You can easily test the “abstraction” by injecting a mock or stub implementation.
- Unit Testing the Implementation: Each concrete implementation can be tested independently of a specific abstraction.
- Integration Tests: Verify that pairing them works as expected.

This separation often simplifies unit testing, because you can isolate each dimension.

** 6.6 Recognizing Bridge in Real Code
Look for classes that store a reference to an interface or trait representing another dimension of behavior. For instance, a “Document” class that has a “Renderer” field, or a “Vehicle” class that references an “Engine” object. If you see parallel class hierarchies (like multiple vehicle types, multiple engine types) but no exponential explosion of classes, you’re probably looking at a Bridge (or a related design approach).

** 6.7 Overuse vs. Necessity
If you only need a single rendering approach, or you don’t foresee adding new shape types, the Bridge might be superfluous. Over-engineering can hamper agility. But if you strongly anticipate expansions in both your abstraction and your implementation realms, or you want to keep them decoupled, the Bridge is among the cleanest solutions.

* 7. Real-World Usage
You’ll find the Bridge pattern in:
- GUI Frameworks: E.g., a widget library might separate the “widget logic” from the “native platform rendering,” bridging them so you can reuse the same code across Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.
- Persistence Layers: Some systems keep an abstract “Repository” or “Data Access” layer that defers to different “drivers” or “storage backends” (SQL, NoSQL, etc.). The Bridge is implicit in how the repository references a data implementation.
- Networking: A client class might store a reference to an abstract “Transport” implementation. That transport might be plain TCP, HTTP, or a specialized protocol. The Bridge allows these to evolve without forcing new client subclasses.
- Game Engines: For instance, separating “Entity” logic from “Rendering/Physics engine” implementations. The engine can be swapped out, while entities keep their logic intact.

* 8. Conclusion
The Bridge pattern is a powerful way to handle two or more dimensions of variation in your software without creating a combinatorial explosion of subclasses. By decoupling the “abstraction” (what your object does or represents) from the “implementation” (how it is actually performed or rendered), Bridge enhances flexibility, testability, and long-term maintainability.

We explored this via:
- Python (Beginner): A straightforward shapes vs. renderers example, demonstrating the classic scenario of bridging geometry and drawing.
- Guile Scheme (Intermediate): A report system that separates different report types (summary, detailed) from different output formats (plain text, LaTeX), illustrating how bridging transcends language paradigms.
- Rust (Advanced): A concurrency-friendly notification system, where multiple alerts can share different “notifier” implementations. We leveraged Rust’s traits and generics to implement the Bridge in a type-safe, multi-threaded environment.

Across these examples, the essence is the same: you maintain parallel hierarchies—one for the high-level abstraction, another for the low-level implementation—and provide a “bridge” (often a reference, pointer, or field) so each abstraction instance can rely on one of the available implementations. By doing so, you can add new abstractions or new implementations freely, with minimal code changes. Such architectural decoupling remains invaluable in modern software, ensuring that as your system grows and evolves, you avoid needless duplication and keep each dimension as open for extension and closed for modification as possible.
