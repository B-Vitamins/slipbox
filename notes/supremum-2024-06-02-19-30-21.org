#+TITLE: Supremum
#+FILETAGS: :concept:
#+SETUPFILE: ~/.config/emacs/setup/setupfile.org

The definition of supremum depends on the notion of [[id:c4fd37c6-3784-44d2-84ec-a75d01bc6b17][partial order]] and [[id:e15f8f6e-7897-42a0-a7d3-cb70193f9a67][upper bound]].

#+NAME: Lower bound
#+begin_definition latex
Let \(S\) be a subset of a partially ordered set \((P, \leq)\). An upper bound \(b\) of \(S\) is called a supremum (or least upper bound, or join) of \(S\) if for all upper bounds \(z\) of \(S\) in \(P, z \geq b\), i.e., \(b\) is less than any other upper bound.
#+end_definition

+ Given a set \(S\) of real numbers, the supremum or least upper bound of \(S\) is the smallest real number that is greater than or equal to every number in \(S\).
+ The supremum may or may not be an element of the set \(S\). For example, consider the set \(S=\{x \in\) \(\mathbb{R} \mid x<3\}\). \(\sup S=3\), even though it is not an element of \(S\).
+ If the supremum is an element of the set, it is also called the maximum. For example, consider the set \(S=\) \(\{1,2,3\}\). \(\sup S=3\), which is also the maximum of \(S\).
