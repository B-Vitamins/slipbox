*Thomas Bayes* was born in Tunbridge Wells and was a clergyman as well as an amateur scientist and a mathematician. He studied logic and theology at Edinburgh University and was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1742 . During the 18th century, issues regarding probability arose in connection with gambling and with the new concept of insurance. One particularly important problem concerned so-called inverse probability. A solution was proposed by Thomas Bayes in his paper *Essay towards solving a problem in the doctrine of chances*, which was published in 1764 , some three years after his death, in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. In fact, Bayes only formulated his theory for the case of a uniform prior, and it was Pierre-Simon Laplace who independently rediscovered the theory in general form and who demonstrated its broad applicability.
