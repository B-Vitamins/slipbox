#+NAME: marginal-probability
#+BEGIN_DEFINITION
Marginal probability refers to the probability of an event occurring irrespective of the outcome of another variable. If \(X\) is a random variable within a probability space and \(X\) can take values \(x\) from a set of possible outcomes, the marginal probability of \(X\) taking a specific value \(x\) is defined as:
\[
P(X = x) = \sum_{y} P(X = x, Y = y)
\]
where \(Y\) is another random variable that can affect the outcome space, and the sum is taken over all possible values of \(Y\).
#+END_DEFINITION

This formula shows that the marginal probability of \(X = x\) is obtained by summing the [[id:7214a7da-7048-4c8a-9ab1-a3590a199ccd][Joint probability]] of \(X = x\) and \(Y = y\) for all possible values of \(Y\). This is essential for understanding the overall likelihood of specific outcomes in a probabilistic model, independent of other variables. Marginal probability is crucial for calculating expected values and variances and for making predictions in the absence of complete information about all influencing factors.
