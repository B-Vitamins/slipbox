#+NAME: Interval
#+begin_definition latex
An interval is a subset of the real numbers that contains all real numbers lying between any two numbers of the subset. 
#+end_definition

The *endpoints* of an interval are its [[id:dc1d007a-cb98-45cd-b6bd-b036cb0506e1][supremum]] and its [[id:cc7c0636-daa4-465e-95c8-c615e2bded3d][infimum]], if they exist as real numbers.

+ If the infimum does not exist, one says often that the corresponding endpoint is \( - \infty \).
+ If the supremum does not exist, one says that the corresponding endpoint is \( + \infty \).

Intervals are completely determined by their endpoints and whether each endpoint belong to the interval. This is a consequence of the [[id:0c4de6be-3c64-4ff2-9043-34beffeda1d9][Least upper bound property (for real numbers)]].
