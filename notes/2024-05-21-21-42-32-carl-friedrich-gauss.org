It is said that when Gauss went to elementary school at age 7, his teacher BÃ¼ttner, trying to keep the class occupied, asked the pupils to sum the integers from 1 to 100. To the teacher's amazement, Gauss arrived at the answer in a matter of moments by noting that the sum can be represented as 50 pairs \((1+100\), \(2+99\), etc.) each of which added to 101, giving the answer 5,050. It is now believed that the problem which was actually set was of the same form but somewhat harder in that the sequence had a larger starting value and a larger increment. Gauss was a German mathematician and scientist with a reputation for being a hard-working perfectionist. One of his many contributions was to show that least squares can be derived under the assumption of normally distributed errors. \(\mathrm{He}\) also created an early formulation of non-Euclidean geometry (a self-consistent geometrical theory that violates the axioms of Euclid) but was reluctant to discuss it openly for fear that his reputation might suffer if it were seen that he believed in such a geometry. At one point, Gauss was asked to conduct a geodetic survey of the state of Hanover, which led to his formulation of the normal distribution, now also known as the Gaussian. After his death, a study of his diaries revealed that he had discovered several important mathematical results years or even decades before they were published by others.
