The first law is formulated in terms of a [[id:df6bf294-bc8a-441f-b16a-02fe248d59a9][state function]] called [[id:7f36257b-4d45-453a-b704-ca458b4c941a][internal energy]] and a quantity called [[id:5211418e-55fa-4d7e-b2f5-88148f84cc76][heat]].

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
By convention the signs of work and heat indicate the energy added to the system, and not vice versa.

#+NAME: The first law of thermodynamics
#+begin_law latex
The first law of thermodynamics states that to change the state of a system we need a fixed amount of energy, which can be in the form of mechanical work or heat
\[
\mathrm{d} E= \mathrm{đ} Q + \mathrm{đ} W.
\]
This can also be regarded as a way of defining and quantifying the exchanged heat.
