title = {When Does a Mixture of Products Contain a Product of Mixtures?},
author = {Montufar, Guido F. and Morton, Jason},
abstract = {We derive relations between theoretical properties of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), popular machine learning models which form the building blocks of deep learning models, and several natural notions from discrete mathematics and convex geometry. We give implications and equivalences relating RBM-representable probability distributions, perfectly reconstructible inputs, Hamming modes, zonotopes and zonosets, point configurations in hyperplane arrangements, linear threshold codes, and multi-covering numbers of hypercubes. As a motivating application, we prove results on the relative representational power of mixtures of product distributions and products of mixtures of pairs of product distributions (RBMs) that formally justify widely held intuitions about distributed representations. In particular, we show that a mixture of products requiring an exponentially larger number of parameters is needed to represent the probability distributions which can be obtained as products of mixtures.},

abstract = {The notions of pure states and inherent structures, i.e. stable configurations against 1-spin flip are discussed. We explain why these different concepts accidentally coincide in mean-field models with infinite connectivity and present an exactly solvable unidimensional model where they do not. At zero temperature pure states are to some extent related to k-spin flip stable configurations with k going to infinity after the thermodynamical limit has been taken. This relationship is supported by an explicit analysis of the TAP equations and calculation of the number of pure states and k-spin flips stable configurations in a mean-field model with finite couplings. Finally we discuss the relevance of the concepts of pure states and inherent structures in finite dimensional glassy systems.},

author = {Süzen, Mehmet and Cerdà, J. J. and Weber, Cornelius},
abstract = {Establishing associations between the structure and the generalisation ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) is a challenging task in modern machine learning. Producing solutions to this challenge will bring progress both in the theoretical understanding of DNNs and in building new architectures efficiently. In this work, we address this challenge by developing a new complexity measure based on the concept of {Periodic Spectral Ergodicity} (PSE) originating from quantum statistical mechanics. Based on this measure a technique is devised to quantify the complexity of deep neural networks from the learned weights and traversing the network connectivity in a sequential manner, hence the term cascading PSE (cPSE), as an empirical complexity measure. This measure will capture both topological and internal neural processing complexity simultaneously. Because of this cascading approach, i.e., a symmetric divergence of PSE on the consecutive layers, it is possible to use this measure for Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We demonstrate the usefulness of this measure in practice on two sets of vision models, ResNet and VGG, and sketch the computation of cPSE for more complex network structures.},
